with this project you will be able to select how many teams are in the league and how many weeks are in the season. After these two inputs are entered it will ask you
for the team name and then for the scores for the number of weeks selected. This will repeat for the number of teams selected, so if you chose to have 5 teams then you 
will be asked for the team name and then scores for each week 5 times. When all of the information for each team and their scores have been filled the console will display
the team names and their scores for each week with a week average for each week and an average for each team at the end of their row.
